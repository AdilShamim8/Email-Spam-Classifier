## Introduction
Email spam is a common problem that can clutter inboxes and pose security risks. This project aims to solve this issue by building a robust classifier that differentiates between spam and legitimate emails. The approach involves:
- Preprocessing email text (tokenization, cleaning, etc.)
- Extracting features using techniques such as TF-IDF
- Training a classification model (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM) on a labeled dataset
- Evaluating model performance using standard metrics

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and tokenize email content.
- **Feature Extraction:** Utilize TF-IDF vectorization for text features.
- **Model Training:** Implement classifiers such as Naive Bayes or SVM.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Prediction:** Easily classify new emails using the trained model.

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
