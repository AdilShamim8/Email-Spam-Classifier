## Introduction
Email spam is a common problem that can clutter inboxes and pose security risks. This project aims to solve this issue by building a robust classifier that differentiates between spam and legitimate emails. The approach involves:
- Preprocessing email text (tokenization, cleaning, etc.)
- Extracting features using techniques such as TF-IDF
- Training a classification model (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM) on a labeled dataset
- Evaluating model performance using standard metrics

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and tokenize email content.
- **Feature Extraction:** Utilize TF-IDF vectorization for text features.
- **Model Training:** Implement classifiers such as Naive Bayes or SVM.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Prediction:** Easily classify new emails using the trained model.

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/email-spam-classifier.git
cd email-spam-classifier
```

Install the required dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Prepare the Dataset:**  
   Ensure your dataset is formatted correctly (e.g., CSV file with labels for spam and non-spam emails).

2. **Preprocess the Data:**  
   Run the preprocessing script to clean and tokenize email text.
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```

3. **Train the Model:**  
   Train your classifier using the training script.
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

4. **Evaluate the Model:**  
   Evaluate model performance on the test set.
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

5. **Make Predictions:**  
   Use the prediction script to classify new emails.
   ```bash
   python predict.py --input "Your email text here..."
   ```

## Dataset
The project is designed to work with publicly available email datasets (e.g., the [SpamAssassin Public Corpus](https://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/)) or your own custom dataset. Make sure the dataset is in the required format before running the scripts.

## Results
After training, the classifier typically achieves competitive performance. For example, you might see an accuracy of around **X%**, with detailed metrics provided in the `results/` folder. Feel free to update this section with your own experimental results.
